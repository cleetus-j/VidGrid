# VidGrid
This is a small graphical tool for easing the visualization of screen coordinates, in my case for Mega Drive development. Just load a screenshot, and press the grid button,
 and it will draw a grid on it, and will give you the below coordinates: 
 - Absolute coordinates.
 - Eight by eight blocks, for text, mapping or other purpose.
 - Sprites, which start at 128,128.
 This program can be used with SecondBasic for example, this is the one I also use.
 This is my first graphical program, please be easy on it, I've cobbled the code and modified it according to my needs.
